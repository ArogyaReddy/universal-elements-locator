# üéØ Scan Page Elements Functionality - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING

All requested functionality for the "Scan Page Elements" workflow has been successfully implemented and is working correctly.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Side-by-Side Button Layout

- **"Scan Page Elements"** and **"View Scanned Results"** buttons are positioned side by side
- Uses CSS flexbox layout with `scan-buttons` container
- Both buttons have matching styles and hover effects
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

### 2. Initial Button States

- **"View Scanned Results"** button is disabled by default (grayed out)
- **"Scan Page Elements"** button is always enabled and ready
- Clear visual indication when buttons are disabled vs enabled
- Proper cursor states (not-allowed for disabled, pointer for enabled)

### 3. Element Highlighting During Scan

- Elements are highlighted with bright green border (`#00ff88`) during scan
- Uses visual effects: outline, box-shadow, and z-index elevation
- Gentle flash animation when highlighting is applied
- Only visible elements are highlighted (skips hidden/invisible elements)
- Highlighting is optional and can be toggled via checkbox

### 4. Scan Completion Flow

- After successful scan, **"View Scanned Results"** button is automatically enabled
- Status message updates to show scan results summary
- User gets immediate feedback about scan success and element count
- Button state change provides clear visual cue that results are ready

### 5. Results Viewing

- **"View Scanned Results"** opens `results.html` in a new browser tab
- Maintains scan data through Chrome storage API
- Results page shows comprehensive element analysis
- Full-width, responsive table with detailed element information

### 6. Auto-Cleanup

- Element highlighting automatically clears after 3 seconds
- No manual cleanup required from user
- Prevents visual clutter on the page
- Restores original element styles perfectly
