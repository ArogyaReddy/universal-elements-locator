echo "🌟 Shadow DOM Comprehensive Fix Test"
echo "===================================="

echo "📄 Shadow DOM test page available at:"
echo "   file://$(pwd)/shadow-dom-test.html"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Testing Instructions:"
echo "========================"
echo ""
echo "1. RELOAD THE EXTENSION:"
echo "   - Go to chrome://extensions/"
echo "   - Find 'Universal Element Locator'"
echo "   - Click the reload button (circular arrow)"
echo ""
echo "2. OPEN THE SHADOW DOM TEST PAGE:"
echo "   - Open a new tab"
echo "   - Navigate to: file://$(pwd)/shadow-dom-test.html"
echo "   - You should see sections for Regular DOM, Simple Shadow DOM, Complex Shadow DOM, Nested Shadow DOM, and Custom Web Components"
echo ""
echo "3. SCAN THE PAGE:"
echo "   - Click the Universal Element Locator extension icon"
echo "   - Ensure 'Include Shadow DOM elements' is checked (should be by default)"
echo "   - Click 'Scan Page Elements'"
echo "   - The extension should highlight elements including those in Shadow DOM"
echo ""
echo "4. VIEW RESULTS:"
echo "   - Click 'View Scanned Results'"
echo "   - Look at the statistics at the top"
echo ""
echo "🔍 What to Look For:"
echo "==================="
echo ""
echo "✅ STATISTICS SHOULD SHOW:"
echo "   - Total Elements: 50+ (including Shadow DOM elements)"
echo "   - Shadow DOM: 20+ elements (NOT 0!)"
echo "   - Primary Locators: Multiple elements with IDs, data attributes"
echo "   - Secondary Locators: Multiple elements with classes, roles"
echo ""
echo "✅ IN THE RESULTS TABLE:"
echo "   - Elements with 'Shadow DOM' tag/indicator"
echo "   - Locators showing '/* Shadow DOM */' prefix for shadow elements"
echo "   - Mix of regular DOM and Shadow DOM elements"
echo "   - Elements from nested shadow roots"
echo "   - Custom web component elements"
echo ""
echo "✅ SHADOW DOM ELEMENTS TO FIND:"
echo "   - shadow-title (h3 in simple shadow)"
echo "   - shadow-btn (button in simple shadow)"
echo "   - shadow-input (input in simple shadow)"
echo "   - complex-title (h3 in complex shadow)"
echo "   - shadow-name, shadow-email (form inputs in complex shadow)"
echo "   - outer-title, inner-title (nested shadow elements)"
echo "   - inner-input (deeply nested input)"
echo "   - custom-button, card-action (web component elements)"
echo ""
echo "❌ BEFORE THE FIX (PROBLEMS):"
echo "   - Shadow DOM count would be 0"
echo "   - Only regular DOM elements would be found"
echo "   - Missing shadow-* elements entirely"
echo "   - Total element count would be much lower"
echo ""
echo "📝 Element Type Breakdown Expected:"
echo "===================================="
echo "   - Regular DOM: ~15 elements (page structure, regular buttons/inputs)"
echo "   - Simple Shadow DOM: ~5 elements (title, text, button, input, span)"
echo "   - Complex Shadow DOM: ~12 elements (form elements, table cells, buttons)"
echo "   - Nested Shadow DOM: ~8 elements (outer + inner shadow elements)"
echo "   - Custom Components: ~6 elements (custom button + card components)"
echo ""
echo "🔧 Debugging Tips:"
echo "=================="
echo "   - Check browser console for Shadow DOM discovery logs"
echo "   - Look for messages like 'Found Shadow DOM on element:'"
echo "   - Verify highlighting works on shadow elements during scan"
echo "   - Check that locators include shadowDOM: true property"
echo ""
echo "🚀 Success Criteria:"
echo "==================="
echo "   ✅ Shadow DOM count > 0 (should be 20+)"
echo "   ✅ Total elements significantly increased from before"
echo "   ✅ Shadow elements appear in results with proper indicators"
echo "   ✅ Locators work for both regular and shadow DOM elements"
echo "   ✅ Nested shadow DOM elements are discovered"
echo "   ✅ Custom web component elements are found"
echo ""
echo "Ready to test Shadow DOM scanning! 🌟"
