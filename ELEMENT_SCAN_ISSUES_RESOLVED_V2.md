# 🔧 Element Scan Issues - RESOLVED v2

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Instruction Banner Not Disappearing

**Problem**: The "Element Scan Mode: Hover to highlight, Click to select, ESC to exit" banner remained visible after clicking an element.

**Root Cause**: The removal function was using an incorrect CSS selector that couldn't find the instruction element.

**Fix Applied**:

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect selector):
const instructions = document.querySelectorAll(
  'div[style*="Element Scan Mode"]'
);

// AFTER (proper ID selector):
instruction.id = "universal-locator-scan-instruction";
const instruction = document.getElementById(
  "universal-locator-scan-instruction"
);
if (instruction) {
  instruction.remove();
}
```

**Result**: ✅ Instruction banner now properly disappears when element is selected.

### Issue 2: Locators Popup Not Appearing

**Problem**: After clicking an element, no popup with locators appeared, making it impossible to see the Primary/Secondary/Fallback locators.

**Root Cause**: The popup was trying to be created in the extension popup context, but the user had switched to the webpage tab, so the extension popup wasn't visible to receive the message.

**Fix Applied**:

```javascript
// BEFORE (popup only in extension):
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "elementScanned", elementData });

// AFTER (popup directly on webpage + extension fallback):
showElementLocatorsOnPage(elementData); // Direct popup on webpage
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "elementScanned", elementData }); // Extension fallback
```

**New Function Added**: `showElementLocatorsOnPage()` - Creates a full-featured locators popup directly on the webpage with:

- Element information display
- Primary/Secondary/Fallback categorization
- Copy and Test buttons for each locator
- Professional styling and layout

**Result**: ✅ Locators popup now appears immediately on the webpage after element selection.
